I work for an international technology company, but I still can't seem to keep my hands off the keyboard in my free time.
I consider myself a consultant, technical writer, developer, system administrator, and a photographer.
I'm always in the process of learning something new, constantly trying to get my head around some new tool, technique or software library.
I'm particularly interested in storage, virtualization, automation, monitoring, web technologies, Linux and open source software.

My [personal website](https://byteshell.net) or my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/acch) are probably good starting points to learn more about how I <del>waste</del> spend my time.
