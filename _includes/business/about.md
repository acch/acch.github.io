As a Lab Services consultant for IBM Systems I'm helping clients design, implement and efficiently manage smarter storage solutions. I am an expert on software defined storage and scale-out file solutions, with a strong background in open source technology.
I joined the IBM Storage Software Development team in 2003, was with the Linux Integration Center in 2005, and since 2006 I'm a member of the EMEA Storage Competence Center in Germany.
